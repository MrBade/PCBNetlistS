The dataset contains two content subjects, which are the netlist description file and the component package picture, in which the netlist takes the component as the subject and describes the type information of the component and the connection of the line network in the following format:
[
Component name
Component Category
Number of pins
Pin Number, Network Number
]
Component pictures, on the other hand, describe the styles of different component types and provide the basic conditions for netlist visualization.
By reading these component pictures and netlist files, users are able to construct circuit relationships and perform schematic generation experiments.
